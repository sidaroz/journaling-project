    description:
      "Yes, I would say that fish do sleep. Some fish actually lie on the bottom at night.

    description:
      "There is a popular folk myth that if one holds a seashell—specifically, most often, a conch shell—to one's ear, one can hear the sound of the ocean. The rushing sound that one hears is in fact the noise of the surrounding environment, resonating within the cavity of the shell.",
